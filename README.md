cheat update list

developer tools -> network tab -> right click .mp3 or whatever file -> block request url to get rid of audio or damage affects or whatever file you want to improve performance

put the following in console (ctrl shift j):

for(var b in window) {
    if(window.hasOwnProperty(b)) console.log(b);
}

it will list all variables lol

override file list but maybe does nothing

maybe use websockets for wallhack

block sniper-scope[whatever].webp

if the page does not load when dev tools are opened but it shows a "VM[xxx] play" file, try adding the "play" and "match-link" files to script block lists
